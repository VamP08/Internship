# 📅 Day 3 — July 4, 2025  
**Week:** 1 – Clean Python & Code Quality

---

## ✅ What I Did Today
- Read GitHub’s “About Pull Request Reviews” and Real Python’s review best practices  
- Created `docs/CodeReview.md` covering:
  - Definition of code review and PR  
  - When to open a PR  
  - Review checklist (style, tests, docs, naming, security)  
  - Explanation of “LGTM” and merge strategies (squash vs rebase vs merge)  
- Reviewed an open-source PR: [example PR link] — left 3 constructive comments on naming, tests, and documentation  
- Enabled branch protection for `main`: require PR reviews and passing checks

## 🧠 What I Learned
- **Code Review**: essential for catching bugs, improving readability, and sharing knowledge  
- **Branch Protection**: enforces quality gates before merging  
- **Merge Strategies**:
  - **Squash & Merge**: combines commits into one, keeps history clean  
  - **Rebase & Merge**: reapplies commits, preserves linear history  
- **LGTM**: informal sign-off indicating a reviewer’s approval

## ❓ Questions / Blockers
- Should I enforce a minimum number of approvals (e.g., 2) for larger PRs?  
- Any best practices for documenting code review outcomes (e.g., using issue trackers)?

- Branch protection screenshot: *(add image link or description)*  
- Reviewed PR: https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/12345 (example)

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Merge `docs/CodeReview.md` PR and delete its branch  
- Prepare for Week 1 Day 4: Static Analysis & Linters
