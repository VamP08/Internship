# 📅 Day 4 — July 6, 2025  
**Week:** 1 – Clean Python & Code Quality

---

## ✅ What I Did Today
- Installed and configured static analysis tools:  
  - `flake8` for style and complexity  
  - `mypy` for static type checks  
  - `bandit` for security linting  
- Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to run all three tools  
- Created `.flake8` and `mypy.ini` configuration files  
- Fixed type issues, unused imports, and bandit security warnings in `csv_parser.py`  
- Ran `pre-commit run --all-files` until all checks passed  
- Submitted and merged PR with all tool configs and fixes

## 🧠 What I Learned
- **Static Analysis** helps catch errors, code smells, and vulnerabilities without running the code  
- **flake8** checks formatting and complexity  
- **mypy** enforces correctness of type annotations  
- **bandit** detects risky patterns like hardcoded passwords, `eval()`, and unsafe subprocess use  
- How to integrate these tools into the pre-commit pipeline for future safety

## ❓ Questions / Blockers
- Should I start treating mypy type errors as strict blockers (CI fail) now or after Week 2?  
- Any suggestions for good VSCode plugins for bandit and flake8?

- Updated files:
  - `.flake8`, `mypy.ini`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`  
  - `src/week1/csv_parser.py` (fixes to pass all tools)

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Start Week 2: Git Workflows & Version Control in collaborative teams  
- Continue using pre-commit pipeline with each PR
