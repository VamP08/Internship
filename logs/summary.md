## ðŸ“… Week Dates:
**Start:** July 2, 2025  
**End:** July 6, 2025

## âœ… What I Accomplished

- Set up `black`, `isort`, and `pre-commit` for auto-formatting  
- Refactored a CSV parser with `@dataclass` and type hints  
- Wrote unit tests with `pytest` using `tmp_path` and fixture data  
- Created a test schema for delivery record parsing  
- Learned and documented code review standards in `docs/CodeReview.md`  
- Reviewed an open-source PR and enabled branch protection on my own repo  
- Integrated `flake8`, `mypy`, and `bandit` for full code quality and security linting

## ðŸ“š Tools & Concepts Learned

| Tool        | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `black`     | Code formatting (PEP8) |
| `isort`     | Auto-sorting Python imports |
| `pytest`    | Python testing framework |
| `flake8`    | Linting for style and complexity |
| `mypy`      | Type checking for function and variable annotations |
| `bandit`    | Security scanner for Python |
| `pre-commit`| Hook to run linters/formatters before Git commits |
| GitHub PR   | Open-source contribution workflow |
| Code Review | Collaboration, feedback, and merge strategies |

## ðŸ§  Reflection

> I now understand what it means to write clean, production-grade Python code.  
> Setting up automated tools made me more confident in catching bugs and style issues early.  
> Practicing code reviews taught me how engineers in real companies communicate and maintain quality.  
> I feel ready to work in team-based environments and follow industry best practices for code hygiene.

## ðŸ”œ Goals for Week 2
- Master branching, rebasing, and pull request workflows  
- Contribute to team-like environments and handle merge conflicts  
- Apply version control strategies used at companies like Google & Microsoft
